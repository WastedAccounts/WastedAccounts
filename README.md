- 👋 Hi, I’m @WastedAccounts
- 👀 I’m interested in building on my SRE experience. 
- 🌱 I run a 2 node bare metal k8s cluster behind a hardware pfSense router for my homelab.  
- 💞️ I'm building a fitness management tool call goodadvice built in Go. Covid ended gym time and after moving to a home gym this has been a fun way to track and manage progress.
